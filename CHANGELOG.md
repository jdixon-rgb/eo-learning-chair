## v1.32.3 — 2026-04-10

### Fiscal Year
- Scenarios are now fiscal-year-scoped (migration 019) — each year gets its own what-if planning.
- Speakers and venues remain cross-year (persistent).

## v1.32.2 — 2026-04-10

### Settings
- Settings link now visible in Super Admin's own nav (not just when viewing as Learning Chair).

## v1.32.1 — 2026-04-10

### Settings & Permissions
- Settings page (Board Positions & Assignments) restricted to Super Admin, Executive Director, and Experience Coordinator — no longer visible to Learning Chair or other individual chairs.
- Staff roles (Executive Director, Experience Coordinator, Executive Assistant) no longer show fiscal year fields — they're ongoing positions without year scoping.

## v1.32.0 — 2026-04-10

### Fiscal Year Infrastructure
- **Fiscal year selector** in admin sidebar — switch between current FY (2025–2026), next FY, and two years out. All admin roles can see it.
- **Year-scoped data**: events, chair reports, member scorecards, and navigator pairings are now filtered by the selected fiscal year.
- **President/theme context**: dashboard and calendar show the president name and theme for the selected fiscal year (from role assignments), not hardcoded values.
- **Database migration** (018): adds `fiscal_year` column to events, chair_reports, member_scorecards, and navigator_pairings; backfills existing data as "2025-2026".
- **Centralized fiscal year utilities** (`src/lib/fiscalYear.js`) replace ad-hoc FY calculations throughout the codebase.
- Replaced all hardcoded "FY 2026–2027" strings with dynamic values from the fiscal year context.

## v1.31.2 — 2026-04-10

### Portal
- Simplified header to show only the chapter logo — removed "Learning Chair / Member Portal" text to reflect the broader scope of the portal.

## v1.31.1 — 2026-04-10

### Reflections
- All forum mates can now edit any parking lot entry (scores, name, author) — not just the original author. "None of us are admins over anybody else." RLS updated to match (migration 017).
- Edit controls (inline score dropdowns, edit/delete buttons) persist after author reassignment.

## v1.31.0 — 2026-04-10

### SAP Partners
- **New SAP Partners page** — tier-grouped directory (Platinum/Gold/Silver/In-Kind) with expandable partner cards, contact management, forum-trained tracking, and list/tier view toggle
- SAP store with full CRUD for partners and contacts, optimistic writes, Supabase hydration
- Migration `015_sap_partners.sql` — evolves `saps` table to company-level records with tiers, adds `sap_contacts` table with RLS
- "Partners" nav item in Learning Chair sidebar

---

## v1.30.0 — 2026-04-10

### Reflections
- Parking lot entries now show author name (resolved from `author_member_id` → chapter members). Your own entries show "You."
- New **filter by forum mate** dropdown at the top of the parking lot — view everyone's items or just one person's
- Edit modal now includes an **author picker** so you can reassign entries to the correct forum mate (for items entered on someone else's behalf)

## v1.29.3 — 2026-04-08

### Reflections
- Parking lot Importance and Urgency scores are now inline-editable for the author of each entry — change the dropdown and it saves immediately. Combined score updates to match.

## v1.29.2 — 2026-04-08

### Reflections
- Parking lot items can now be added directly without first creating a reflection — "Add item" button on the parking lot view (in both empty state and list header)
- Dialog copy adapts: "Declare to parking lot" when coming from a reflection, "Add to parking lot" when standalone

## v1.29.1 — 2026-04-08

### Member Portal
- Sidebar "Member Portal" link now goes to the portal home (`/portal`) instead of the calendar

## v1.29.0 — 2026-04-08

### Member Engagement Chair (new role + module)
- New `engagement_chair` role and `canManageEngagement` permission (DB migration 013)
- New per-chair-role command center registry (`src/lib/chairRoles.js`) — each chair role gets its own sidebar title, landing page, and nav items. Adding a new chair role surface is a registry entry + routes; no Sidebar refactor.
- Sidebar dynamically reconfigures based on the user's effective role. The hardcoded "Learning Chair" title is gone — it now reflects whichever chair you're logged in as.
- **View-as switcher** (super admin only) in the sidebar header — impersonate any chair role to see the surface that role sees. Light impersonation: layout/nav swaps, underlying permissions still you.
- Login/root redirect (`/`) now sends each user to their chair role's `homePath` — Learning Chair to `/`, Engagement Chair to `/engagement`.
- New routes: `/engagement` (dashboard), `/engagement/navigators`, `/engagement/pairings`, `/engagement/library`
- **Navigators page** — appoint chapter members as Navigators with bio + capacity hint. Status pills (active/paused/retired), retire/restore/delete actions, soft over-capacity warning.
- **Compass spine + Navigator data model** (DB migration 012): `navigators`, `navigator_pairings`, `navigator_resources`, `navigator_sessions`, `compass_items`. The `compass_items` table is a single per-member personalized signal table that any chair module will write into — the architectural spine for the future personalized "Compass" home view.
- Conversation Library seeded with 10 starter resources — 2 honest FAQs and 7 "Ways to Get Value from EO" entries, contributed by tenured members and Sue Hesse.
- Stub pages for Pairings and Conversation Library (read-only for now).

## v1.28.1 — 2026-04-08

### Reflections
- Wired `/portal/reflections` route so the dashboard tile actually opens the module

## v1.28.0 — 2026-04-08

### Reflections (new module)
- New **Reflections** module in the Member Portal — private, per-forum journaling with three templates:
  - **Modern** — single deep dive with feelings pills, headline, context, significance, three "why is that important?" prompts, and a closing self-insight
  - **Hesse Classic** — MEPS one-word check-in, life-area grid (Professional / Personal-Family × Headline / Emotions / Significance), EQ challenge, IQ topics, and an update field
  - **EO Standard** — the classic 5% worksheet (Work / Family / Personal / Next 30–60 days × Feelings / Headline / Significance) with a group-exploration footer
- **Feelings library** seeded from the NVC inventory and the Hesse 5 Core Emotions (with intensity metadata). Members can add new feelings, which grow the global library.
- **Parking lot** — per-forum shared list of items declared from reflections. Author-named, scored 1–10 on importance and urgency, sorted by combined score. Author-only edit/delete. Parking lot entries are visible to forum-mates only; reflections themselves remain strictly private.
- **Clear all** wipes a member's reflections in their current forum; parking lot entries survive.
- Dashboard tile added to the Member Portal home.
- Empty states for members without a forum assignment — polite invitation to reach out to the Forum Chair.

## v1.27.1 — 2026-04-07
